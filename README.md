# Chase_Color
You can complete the tracks by collecting objects of the same color as the character.
The path taken by the character in the game is endless.In the game, the character is assigned a random color and the character collects objects with the same color as herself.
There are colored cubes to change the character's color, and the color will change when the character collects the cubes.In the left corner of the screen, there is the part that shows the health of the character.
If the character picks up an object with a different color than its own, its health will be reduced.If the character hits the pendulum, the character dies.
When each level is passed in the game, the screen showing which level we will start will appear.There are also start and lose screens in the game.
